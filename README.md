# Waiter
Project for the Software Project 1 class in the University of Iceland.

## How do I get this ?
Your IDE ([IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [Spring Tool Suit](https://spring.io/tools)) should be able to clone a project from Github.
It should be easy to find information regarding how to do that for your chosen IDE.

## How do I run this ?
This project is setup using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) as a dependency manager, so if your IDE does not manage that, or you don't have it installed you can look [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) for further information.
When all the dependencies are downloaded, you can run the project by running the ``main()`` method in the class ``Application`` and then enter [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) into the address bar of your favorite web browser. You can also run the project through https://waiterhbv1.herokuapp.com/demo/frontPage.

### What did you use to make this ?
